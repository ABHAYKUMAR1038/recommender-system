# recommender-system
I have developed a movie recommendation system in machine learning using the cosine similarity/cosine distance to get the best recommendation for  the movie enthusiast.

Project plannig
 
Goal: Develop a movie recommender system that gives personalized
recommendation to the users.

Target Users: Movie admirer seeking recommendation for their next watch.

Step1: Dataset gathering

Step2:Pre-processing(cleaning data set to remove the ambiguity, inconsistancies,
anomalies and making them fit to get our desired output at the end)

Step3:Model-building

Step4:Model-deployment

System Design
   Software Constraints:
   
     Programming Language: The Used language (Python is common)
     will influence available libraries and frameworks for data processing,
     machine learning algorithms.
     
   Hardware Constraints:
   
     Computing Power: Processing power of the computer will be
     required for the training the model. In case of insufficient memory
     we can use the cloud storage.
     
  Memory: The size of available memory will influence the size and
      complexity of datasets we can work with.
